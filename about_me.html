			<p> For my undergraduate degree I studied at the University of Liverpool gaining an MESci in Geology. During my time in Liverpool I developed an interest in structural geology and the deformation of rocks. My degreeculminated in a Master's thesis investigating the effects of temperature in calcite friction in Dan Faulkner's lab. It was a great introduction to world of 'rock squashing' and so I decided to take things further by applying for a PhD.
